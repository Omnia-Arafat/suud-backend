# SU'UD Platform - Role-Based Dashboard System

## Overview

The SU'UD platform now features three distinct dashboards, each tailored to specific user roles with their own functionality, pages, and permissions:

1. **Admin Dashboard** - Platform management and oversight
2. **Employee Dashboard** - Job searching and application management  
3. **Employer Dashboard** - Job posting and candidate management

## Backend Architecture

### Middleware Protection

Each dashboard is protected by role-specific middleware:

- `AdminMiddleware` - Ensures only users with `role = 'admin'` can access admin routes
- `EmployeeMiddleware` - Ensures only users with `role = 'employee'` can access employee routes  
- `EmployerMiddleware` - Ensures only users with `role = 'employer'` can access employer routes

3. **Data Visualization**: Implement charts and analytics displays
4. **Real-time Updates**: Add WebSocket support for live updates
5. **Email Notifications**: Implement role-specific email alerts
6. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure dashboards work on all devices
